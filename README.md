# Referral Triage Basics – Beginner Digital Health Project

## Background
This repository documents my beginner learning in digital health, focusing on how referral triage supports safe and timely patient care in NHS services.

## Clinical Context
Referral triage is used across primary and secondary care to prioritise referrals based on urgency, clinical risk, and service capacity. Digital systems support clinicians by standardising information, enabling early specialist input, and reducing unnecessary delays.

## Project Aim
To explore, at a beginner level, how clear triage principles and simple data summaries can support:
- Safe prioritisation of referrals
- Identification of urgent cases
- Efficient use of specialist services

## Scope
This project is exploratory and educational. It does not use real patient data or live clinical systems.

## Tools Used
- GitHub (documentation and version control)
- VS Code
- Python (basic scripting)

## Next Steps
- Add a simple Python script to simulate referral triage categories
- Reflect on safety, governance, and limitations of digital triage systems
